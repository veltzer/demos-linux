	in the wrapper each thread will have a name.
	Add the ability to connect via telnet to this application and see all of
	it's threads.
- show how this is solved in ACE and Boost and stdlibc++.

- do the example of measuring thread performance as in the manual entry of
	pthread_getcpuclockid

- do example of cancelling a thread.
	pthread_cleanup_pop
	pthread_cleanup_push

- show an example of doing pthread_once (this is a sort of a singleton pattern).

- do an example of yield.

- do an example of pthread_atfork

- do an example of named semaphore usage:
	sem_* functions.

- do examples of mutex usage.

- do examples of futex usage.

- do examples that compare futex to mutex run times.

- do example of thread detach.

- do example of thread local storage ala pthread (see man pthread_setspecific).

- show usage of pthread_exit. Actually, show all ways that allow one to exit a thread
	- pthread_exit
	- pthread_cancell.
	- send sigkill to the thread.
