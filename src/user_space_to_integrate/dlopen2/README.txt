This example shows how to dynamically call a function from a dll which is not known at compile time.

This example uses the dlopen(3) set of functions.

These set of functions can be used for various purposes:
1. Provide a plugin functionality to an application (think of a media player written in C/C++ that can be extended with many coded plugins).
2. Enable an application to call functions of a library whose dependencies conflict with the dependencies of the application (different C library etc).

Use example:
./run_func_from_dll /usr/lib/libm.so sin 6.28

Notes:
You need to know the signature of the functions you are calling (this is quite a fair requirement). This example assumes that you are calling a function that receives a single double argument and returns a double.
