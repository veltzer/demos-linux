Write a "/dev/null" device driver.

Use pieces of code from:
https://github.com/veltzer/demos-linux/tree/master/src/kernel_standalone/mynull

https://github.com/veltzer/demos-linux/tree/master/src/kernel_standalone/mynull/exercise.txt

Try not to crash your kernel.

Show that your driver works.

Don't forget to move the offset with every write operation and write a message to the
kernel log on every write operation.
