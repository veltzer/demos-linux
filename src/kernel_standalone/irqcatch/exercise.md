interrupt catching exercise for linux kernel programmers
========================================================
- find an interrupt that is you can control on your system
	(usb2, mouse, whatever).
- write a kernel module to handle that interrupt
	and show the number of times it was called via
	/proc.
- deregister cleanly.
