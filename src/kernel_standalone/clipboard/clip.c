/*
* TODO:
* We have only one wait queue which is bad if we have multiple clipboards.
* We also have just one in-kernel buffer which is shared by all clipboard
* /dev/ devices.
* store the clipboard itself in the device itself.
* work with an ioctl that can trigger an interrupt.
* write user space demos of how to work with this (do I need this ? won't
* cat and echo do ?).
* add makefile targets for insmod/rmmod etc.
* improve the write method to write as much as it can and return what is
* written.
* if two or more readers or writers are involved we will have race conditions.
* protect the clipboard or allow just one reader/writer (but even then some
* protection would be required).

* Writing to the clipboard. This simply copied the data from user space into
* the in-kernel buffer using copy_from_user. If the clipboard is full we do
* not return 0 since this will cause the user process to think that it had
* reached end of file. Instead, we put it to sleep and wait to be woken up by
* a reader that has read from the clipboard. Then we check the size again
* since the clipboard has chanced. Once we can write any positive amount we
* do the write and return the number of bytes written to the user. Why don't
* we loop until we write the entire buffer of the user (count bytes)? Well,
* we could do it but then we would not comply with the standard UNIX
* semantics for write that state that we should write what we can NOW and
* return the number of bytes written.
*
* A simpler approach would have been to just see if we have at least count
* bytes free in the buffer and return an error if that is not the case.
* This is too simplistic and would break lots of prefectly legal user space
* programs.
