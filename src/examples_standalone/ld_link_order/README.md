This example investigates link order in the GNU toolchain.

This is the dependency graph for this example:

main.elf -> liba.so -> libb.so

What are the results?
- if liba.so supplies function 'a' and libb.so supplies function 'b' and 'a' needs 'b'
	and you like in the right order (-la -lb) then all is ok. even if liba.so does
	not carry the infomation that it is dependent on libb.so.
- if, in the same case as above, you link in the wrong order (-lb -la) you will get
	link errors. Link order matters.
- to make order not matter you can use grouping.
	-Wl,--start-group -lb -la -Wl,--end-group
	but this is not advised as you should know the order of the linking.
- if you link liba.so with libb.so (gcc -shared -o liba.so -L. -lb) then
	you liba.so will carry this information and you can see it using
	'ldd liba.so'
- if liba.so was linked with libb.so then when linking with liba.so there
	is no need to specify '-lb'. But you do need the compiler to know
	where 'libb.so' resides. This cannot be done using the -L flag.
	It can be done using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
	or via the -rpath-link flag to the linker
