The makefile here helps you in querying gcc:
- seeing what optimizations in the compiler are enabled for each -O[N] number.
Note that -O4 and onwards are accepted by gcc but are useless as they provide the same optimizations as -O3...
- seeing what optimizations are with -Ofast, -O, -Os, -Og
- seeing what warnings does gcc support
