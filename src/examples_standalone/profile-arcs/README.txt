This is an example of how to build a piece of software using the -fprofile-arcs
feature.
This feature means that you profile your branch instructions and then feed back
this information into another build phase in order to plant hinted branch
instructions to the CPU.

It seems that using -fprofile-arcs and the -fbranch-probabilities as command line
arcs does not work. Instead we use -fprofile-generate and then -fprofile-use where
-fprofile-generate implies -fprofile-arcs and -fprofile-use implies
-fbranch-probabilities (at least that is what the documentation says).
