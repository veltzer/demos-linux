This example shows how to trigger a breakpoint to a debugger
from your code. This is useful, for instance, when it is hard to express when
you want to break using the debugger API/language.

This example shows that there are several ways by which you can trigger
a debugger interaction:
- asm("int 3");
- raise(SIGTRAP);
- something illegal?!?
