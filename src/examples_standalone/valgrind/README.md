This is an example of how to use valgrind to find memory leaks in your program.

The basic things:
- try to compile with debug information (-g) so that you will get source file
	names and line numbers instead of object file names and code segment pointers.
- run 'valgrind --tool=memcheck [your_program]'
- you can add '-v' or '--leak-check=full' to get extra info.
