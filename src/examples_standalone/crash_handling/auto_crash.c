* OK, we want a way to call the register function (not to mention load the library)
* without messing with source files and re-compiling. Here how it works:
*
* We create a library with a single init function that calls the registration for us
* using a function constructor hook and we'll force the dynamic linker to load it
* in run time using LD_PRELOAD magic.
*
* Pretty, clever, isn't it? :-)
