Exercise 1
1. Write a program that will have two functions FunA and FunB.
	use a loop counter to call Twice FunA and this function will call FunB.
2. Each function will print a message when entered, using the ACE utility.
3. Use the ACE to set and unset this capability.
4. In each function print debugging information using 3 levels:
	1. LM_TRACE
	2. LM_DEBUG
	3. LM_INFO
	Use the following options in each output line:
	1. Print program pid.
	2. Print line number.
	3. Print File Name.

Try to verify what causes indentation.

Hint: Controlling the output may be done by the following command:
ACE_LOG_MSG->priority_mask(LM_DEBUG | LM_INFO | LM_NOTICE | LM_TRACE, ACE_Log_Msg::PROCESS);
