/*
 * This application tries to guess where the next malloc allocation would be...
 *
 * In order to analyze malloc performance take a look at the "mguess_allocated"
 * function.
 * - It seems that malloc always needs at least 4 bytes for internal
 * book keeping. This is where it keeps the size of the block which is allocated
 * (probably - well check it later...).
 * - It is also deducible that malloc always allocated on an 8 byte boundry.
