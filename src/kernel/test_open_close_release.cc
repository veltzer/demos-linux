/*
 * This is a test which will explain which methods in the driver are
 * called. Here are the scenarios which are shown:
 * - a single process opening and closing.
 * - a pair of processes both opening and closing the same file.
 * - a process which open a file and dies.
 * - two processes one which dies.
 *
 * This example explains when open and release are called.
 * open - is called when a unique new fd is created based on the device driver file.
 *	It is NOT called when an already existing fd is duplicated like in the
 *	case of fork(2) or dup(2).
 * release - is called when the final fd of the last process is closed. This means
 *	that no userspace process still holds a connection to that fd.
 *	It is NOT called when a close(2) occurs which is not the last one...
 * Common questions are:
 * 1. how do I know within the driver that a certain process
 * that talked to my driver died?
 * 2. how do I know within the driver that a new process
 * was created that is using a file descriptor that I am serving?
 * 3. how do I know within the driver that a file descriptor
 * that I am serving just god dupped?
 * Some attempts at answers:
 * - you don't. file descriptors in UNIX are NOT tied to
 * one process - they may be shared. You only get notification when they
 * are created or finally destroyed.
 * - one strategy is to not share file descriptors. Close them in the parent or child if
 * you fork or only open them after forks.
 * - have every process which closes the descriptor do
 * an ioctl(2) on it before closing notifying you. The same could be done
 * after fork(2) or dup(2). But why would you want that?
