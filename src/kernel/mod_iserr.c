MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Showing how IS_ERR_VALUE works");

/*
 * This module shows that very high values of pointers (as unsigned longs) are
 * used to pass errors around in the kernel using the IS_ERR_VALUE macro.
 * This means that if there is a function that is supposed to return only
 * an address it will return a very high one and you would check whether it
 * encountered an error using this macro.
 * Same this goes for IS_ERR and real pointers (not unsigned longs).
 * You can also extract the exact error from the pointer using the PTR_ERR
 * inline function.
 * You can also see from this example how to create a pointer that embeds an
 * error using the ERR_PTR inline function.
 *
 * Have a look at $KERNEL_SOURCES/include/linux/err.h for more details.
