MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Show the completion API for completing requests from the kernel");

/*
* The completion API is a fairly recent API within the kernel that is lighter
* than the wait_queue API in that on each completion event you can have just
* one process running. Meaning that the completion structure is NOT a linked
* list but rather just one process(thread) waiting. This is good for writing
* various designs where we lower the request into the kernel and are not sure
* who exactly is going to handle it at lower levels and therefore we would not
* like to commit to specific wait queue at this time (think packet handling
* etc...).
*
* TODO:
* - do dynamic allocation of chrdev and remove the stupid paramters for this
* module.
* - remove unneeded includes.
* - find the right h file to include for the completion API (I am including
* way too much).
* - do better ioctl names instead of numbers.
