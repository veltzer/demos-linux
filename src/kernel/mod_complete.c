MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Show the completion API for completing requests from the kernel");

/*
 * The completion API is a fairly recent API within the kernel that is lighter
 * than the wait_queue API in that on each completion event you can have just
 * one process running. Meaning that the completion structure is NOT a linked
 * list but rather just one process(thread) waiting. This is good for writing
 * various designs where we lower the request into the kernel and are not sure
 * who exactly is going to handle it at lower levels and therefore we would not
 * like to commit to specific wait queue at this time (think packet handling
 * etc...).
 *
 * TODO:
 * - do dynamic allocation of chrdev and remove the stupid paramters for this
 * module.
 * - remove unneeded includes.
 * - find the right h file to include for the completion API (I am including
 * way too much).
 * - do better ioctl names instead of numbers.
