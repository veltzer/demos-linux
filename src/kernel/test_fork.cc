/*
 * This application simply tests what happens at the driver level when user space
 * calls the fork(2) system call.
 *
 * The results:
 * - no call is made to the device driver at fork(2) time.
 * - this is identical to what happens when user space calls clone(2) to create more threads.
 * - this means that at the driver level you cannot distinguish between multi-threaded and
 * processed applications using your driver.
 * - this means that a driver which can only server one "struct filp*" (supports only a single
 * open(2) call) can serve both multi-processed and multi-threaded applications.
 * - this is good.
 * - in this case files backed by device drivers as different from files backed by regular
 * file systems where on fork(2) you get a different offset and options for parent and child.
