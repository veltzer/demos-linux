/*
 *	Take note of the following facts:
 *	- after a driver does a BUG() it cannot be unloaded (reboot will be needed).
 *	- BUG() generates a snipplet in the kernel log that can be used to report
 *		bugs to kernel maintainers.
 *	- BUG() generates a stack trace that you can use for debugging.
 *
 *	TODO:
 *	- examin the behaviour in each of these and describe it.
 *	- add open and ioctl support.
