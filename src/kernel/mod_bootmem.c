MODULE_DESCRIPTION("This is a driver that demos the alloc_bootmem function");

/*
 * Why would you need bootmem ?
 * - you may want a large contiguous buffer to work with some kind of device.
 * after the kernel has loaded and has started to use the systems memory you
 * are no longer guaranteed that such a large contiguous buffer could
 * be obtained.
 * In addition you HAVE NO API to obtain such a buffer even if you were
 * guaranteed that it does exist.
 * kmalloc and other friends have 4MB or some such limit
 * (depending on platform).
 * - if you write a small driver like this, link it to the physical kernel,
 * then the function alloca_bootmem will be found and you will get the memory
 * assigned.
 *
 * How would you use the buffer ?
 * Add yet another function that returns the pointer to the buffer in some way
 * and export it.
 * Other modules, even dynamic ones, could call upon that function and get the
 * pointer and do it whatever they want.
 * If you need it for large contiguous DMA then you
 * could call _pa() on it and get it's physical address and so on.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - is there a dealloc_bootmem function and if so why am I not showing how to
 * use it here ?
