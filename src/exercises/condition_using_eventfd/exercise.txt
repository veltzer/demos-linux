Implement the following pthread functions using eventfd(2):
	mypthread_cond_init (3) - operations on conditions
	mypthread_cond_destroy (3) - operations on conditions
	mypthread_cond_broadcast (3) - operations on conditions
	mypthread_cond_signal (3) - operations on conditions
	mypthread_cond_wait (3) - operations on conditions
	with the same sematics as the pthread library API.
Bonus: suggest a way to improve the pthread_cond API to enable to signal
	a specific thread. Implement your enhancement. Demonstrate by using
	your newly defined condition API to implement a fine grained
	readers/writer lock.
