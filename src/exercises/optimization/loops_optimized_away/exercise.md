- Write a simple program that counts and has a bug.
	compile with optimizations.
- Debug the application.
- Can you print the loop variable? If not, why?
- Find a way to print the loop variable anyway.
- Change the loop variable at runtime using gdb and circumvent
	the bug.

hints:
- info registers
- google search for "setting register values in gdb"
