# Loops Debugging

* Write a simple program that counts and has a bug.
* Compile with optimizations.
* Debug the application.
* Can you print the loop variable? If not, why?
* Find a way to print the loop variable anyway.
* Change the loop variable at runtime using gdb and circumvent the bug.

## Hints
* info registers
* google search for "setting register values in gdb"
