Exercise 3
Write a program that will update a single variable called LockedCounter.
We have to protect the variable so that only one thread will be able to update it.
We will use 3 threads.
1. The initial value of LockedCounter is zero.
2. Use 3 threads each one of them will try to increment the LockedCounter.
3. Each thread will use mutex to prevent other threads from updating or testing
	this variable at the same time.
4. Only if LockedCounter modulu 3 = n (for thread n) then thread n will do
	the increment.
5. Each thread should make X attemts (constant) to change the LockedCounter.
6. At the end print the value of LockedCounter as well as the total number of
	attempts for changing the counter.
7. What do you deduce from the results of this exercise? (the difference in values between the LockedCounter and the attempts...).
8. Answer the following questions:
	- Are the results good?
	- What is the influence of printing inside the loop?
	- Would yielding help?
	- How would you improve it further?
	- How would the thread number influence the result?
	- What will happen if you increase number of cores?

Notes:
use slide 3-39 for mutex support for this exercise.
