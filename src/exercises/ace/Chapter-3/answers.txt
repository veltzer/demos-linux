These are answers to the questions...

Are the results good?
- Nope. We attempt many times per each time slice.
What is the influence of printing inside the loop?
- Improves the results because print is read which yields the CPU.
Would yielding help?
- Yes, if the two threads in question are on the same CPU.
How would you improve it further?
- A condition could help by waking the right thread each time.
How would the thread number influence the result?
- Increasing the thread number would cause more problems since the yield would usually
be wrong. Reducing the thread number would cause less problems.
- What will happen if you increase number of cores?
Usually will cause more problems because more attempts will be made in parallel and will fail.
(decreasing the number of cores will be better...).
