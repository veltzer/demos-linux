# Circle object oriented exercise in C++

Create a class called circle with three members of type double:
* radios: double -> radius of the circle
* x: double -> x position of the center
* y: double -> y position of the center

* Create one constructor or more for the circle.

* Create getters/setters for the various properties.

* Create a method to print the circle

* Add a method `bool inside(double x, double y)`

* Add more method as you please

* Divide the code between `circle.hh` and `circle.cc`

* Demonstrate the use of your class using a `main` function.

## Phase 2

* Add `const` wherever is appropriate.

## Phase 3

* add a method to circle which find if two circles are concentric.

* add another method to circle to find the overlapping circle of concentric circles.

* use references and const where ever possible.

* add initialization lists in the constructor.
