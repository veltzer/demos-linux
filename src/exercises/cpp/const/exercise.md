# Const use in C++

* Write a proper `Rectangle` class with the following methods:
    * `Constructur`
    * `get_area`
    * `get_width`
    * `get_height`
    * `set_width`
    * `set_height`
    * `get_diagonal_length`
    * `get_circumference`
    You decide on the prototypes.
* Use const as much as possible
* Demonstrate the use of your class.
