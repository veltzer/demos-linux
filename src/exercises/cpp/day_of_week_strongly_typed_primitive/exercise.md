# Day of Week Strongly Typed Primitive

Write a type that you can use for DayOfWeek:

* Values are only 1-7
* Conversion to int
* Conversion from int with exception if the value is not in range
* Allow arithmetic on the type

Do that in two ways:

* First way is a separate class with all of the operations inlined.
* Second way is using a double argument template.

Compare the two solutions. Who do you like best?
