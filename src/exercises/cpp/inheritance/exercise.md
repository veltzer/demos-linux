# Inheritance exercise

* Create the following class hierarchy:

	Shape -> [Circle, Rectangle, Triangle]

	For simplicity:
	Circle -> radius
	Rectangle -> a, b
	Triangle -> a, b, c

* Allow the user to create any shapes he/she wants.
* After the user is done, run over all shapes and "draw" them.
* Drawing is NOT to be done graphically -> just print the attributes
* Use references where ever possible.
* Use virtual methods where ever possible.
