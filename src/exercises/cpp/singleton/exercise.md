# Singleton exercise

* Write a singleton class.
* Make sure only one instance of your object can be created (make the constructor private).
* Add a static method `get_instance` to get your instance.
* Make your `get_instance` lazy.
* Use a static member to store the instance.
* Bonus: Try to take care of thread safety and avoid race conditions.
