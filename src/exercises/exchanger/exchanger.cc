/*
 * A solution to the exchanger/randezvous exercise...
 *
 * Notes:
 * - The reason we don't "null" the Exchanger when the second thread
 * comes in and gives it's value is that the first thread is still
 * in the lock. If the second thread by chance will get into the lock
 * (again) before the first thread wakes up, it may accidentaly wake
 * itself up.
 * - The same reason (above) is why we have the delay loop at the
 * begining of the 'get' method and why we are using two conditions
 * instead of just one.
 *
 * References:
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3209918/how-to-implement-an-exchanger-rendezvous-pattern-in-c
 *
 * the next one should be "-lboost_thread" but ubuntu has no symlink to that...
 * EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS=-l:libboost_thread.so.1.49.0
