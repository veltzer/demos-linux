It's harder than it looks to improve the number of iterations because for every number
greater than the first number where the conversion fails to be exact it does not
neccessarily follow that the conversion will failt.

Take a loot at the improved solutions output to see why this fails.
What the failed improvement does find rather quickly is a SINGLE
long long number who's conversion to and from float is inacurrate.
