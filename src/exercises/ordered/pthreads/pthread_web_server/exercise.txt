web server exercise
===================
write a web server using the pthread API.
start by building a simple echo server
- see that the echo server works by using
	telnet localhost [your port number]
- change the server to be a stupid HTTP server.
	Read the ENTIRE response from a file.
	and send the file content as the response.
- see that a browser shows your HTML code.
- see that it also works for more than one client (open multiple browser tabs)
- create a client that works with multiple threads
	and issues requests to your server.
- use tcpdump to see the communication between
	your clients and server.

Notes:
to compile with pthread support use:
	g++ hello.cc -o hello -lpthread
