Write your own implementation of ls -l. Try to make it emit output
which is as close to the ls -l output as possible.
Here is how to compare your output with the output of ls:
$ cd [somedir] # go to some directory
$ unalias ls # make ls not do colors (it's not in the exercise)
$ ls -l > realls # save the output of ls
$ ~/myls > myls # save the output from my ls
$ diff realls myls # shows the differeces

You should show: type of file, permissions, hard link count,
owner(in string form), group(in string form), file size, modification
date, and file name. For symbolic links: name -> orig should be displayed.

Write a makefile that compiles your program.
$ make # should build the program
$ make clean # should remove all generated files

Compile your program with -Wall -Werror (do not allow any errors!).
Always take care of errors when calling system calls or library calls.

Hints:
Use stat(2), readlink(2), opendir(3), readdir(3), closedir(3) , getpwnam(3), getgrnam(3).

Good luck!
