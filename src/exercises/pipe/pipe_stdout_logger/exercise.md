# Pipe STDOUT Logger

This is a pipe exercise.

You are given an executable which prints to STDOUT. You cannot change it.
This is the `uncontrolled` executable in this directory.

What do you need to do?
Wrap it in an executable that runs the afore-mentioned executable and
directs it's STDOUT to where-ever and allows for log file rotation and other
features...
