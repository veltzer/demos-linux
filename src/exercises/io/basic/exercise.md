# Basic IO

* In directory /proc resides directories that their names are process Ids. The ownership of each directory is the owner of the process. In each directory there is a sub-directory named `fd` that represents the file descriptor table. The content of /proc/xxx/fd are symbolic link files the process has now open.
* Write a program that scans /proc and finds processes that belong to you.
* Check which files each of your processes uses.
* add a switch â€“r that will only display open files. Verify by running tail -f /var/log/messages
