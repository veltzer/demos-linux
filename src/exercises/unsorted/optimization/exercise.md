# Optimization

* Write a program that computes the sum of numbers from 1 to 100,000 and prints the result

* Compile with optimizations (-O2 or -O3) and with debug info (-g2 or -g3)

* Run the application and verify that the results are OK.

* Disassemble your program using:
    `$ objdump --disassemble --source --demangle [binary] > [output]`

* Find the loop that calculates the sum of numbers.

* What are your conclusions? How does this affect debugging? What if you put a break on the line of the loop?
