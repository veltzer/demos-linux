Write a multi-thread safe message queue to communicate
between threads.

The message queue should be an array of void* pointers.

Here is the API you should implement:

type:
	mq

API:
	int mq_init(mq*, const int maxsize);
		creates the queue with a maximum size of maxsize.
	int mq_destroy(mq*);
		destroys the queue (whatever is needed to be done).
	int mq_put(mq*, void*);
		put a message on the queue.
		goes to sleep if the queue is full.
	void* mq_get(mq*);
		get a message from the queue.
		goes to sleep if the queue is empty.
