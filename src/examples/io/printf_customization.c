 * This demo shows how to customize printf and is taken directly from the glibc info
 * pages.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - this example fails compilation if compiled as C++. It seems like the glibc
 * folk have not paid attention to making the printf.h file C++ safe. This does
 * not work even if you surround the "#include <printf.h>" statement with an
 * "extern "C"" declaration.
 * - I have to turn off warning in a lot of sections here because both the
 * 'register_printf_function' is deprecated and the compiler doesn't work
 * well with printf(3) extensions and so issues warnings about format strings
 * that don't match the arguments sent.
