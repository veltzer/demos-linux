/*
 * This example explores the performance of the write system call...
 *
 * The example is shows that writes to /dev/null have
 * constant performance while writes to a file are different: when
 * the OS buffers are empty they are fast (memcpy to kernel) and when
 * they are full they block...
 *
 * example of running this could be:
 * ./src/examples/io/write_performance.exe /tmp/foo 2000000 100 100 10000000 0
 * You are supposed to see two peaks: one for fast writes which just copies to
 * kernel and one for slow writes that block you...
 *
 * You can also use iotop to see the process consuming first place in the io
 * category.
