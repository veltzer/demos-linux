 * This is an example of what happens when you read from a bad fd.
 * The important thing to note is that you do not SEGFAULT. Technically
 * you called a syscall with the wrong parameter and what you get back
 * is an error.
 * Note yet that read(2) return type is ssize_t which is SIGNED as opposed to size_t
 * which is UNSIGNED. The idea here is the ability to return -1 and report errors
 * this way.
 * Note that if you pass a bad file descriptor it does not matter if you passed
 * NULL as the pointer to be read to...
