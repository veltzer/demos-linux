/*
 * This example is an attempt to improve the basic tee.cc solution by
 * not blocking on the splice(2) system call.
 *
 * The problem with this solution is that if we get a short splice then
 * some data is left in the input stream and this data could be tee(2)ed
 * again. This is because tee(2) does not remember what data it has
 * already tee(2)ed out and just tee(2)s anything it finds.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - show indeed that this is a bug. Produce a real scenario where this produces
 * the wrong output and show that it is wrong.
