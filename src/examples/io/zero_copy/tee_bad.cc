/*
 * This example demonstrates how to implement tee(1) using tee(2)
 * by using zero copy as much as possible.
 * This example is bad as it spins when there is no input.
 * It could be easily fixed by removing the SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK flag,
 * but then it could also be coded in a more elegant way. See tee.cc
 * for an example of this...
 *
 * Notes:
 * - this tee(1) is very limited. Both stdin and stdout HAVE to be pipes.
 * This means that if you don't want to see errors you should run this program
 * like this:
 * cat /etc/passwd | [this program] [outfile] | cat
 * both pipes are neccessary
 *
