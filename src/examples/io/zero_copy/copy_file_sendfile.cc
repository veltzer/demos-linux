/*
 * This demos shows how to use sendfile(2) to avoid copy to/from user space.
 * The demo itself is just a simple version of cp(1)
 *
 * It seems that this demo doesn't run properly on 2.6.32 and should run
 * on 2.6.33 or later.
 * On 2.6.38 it works well.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - we send the data page by page and call sendfile(2) many times. This could
 * be avoided using fstat(2) after the open of the input file and sending the
 * entire content at once. On the other hand this could cause performance issues.
 * This needs to be checked. In any case the buffer of a single page size
 * as is used here seems too small for good performace on todays systems.
