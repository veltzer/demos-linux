/*
 * This example shows how to copy a copy file program using the select system
 * call.
 *
 * The idea is to have a buffer of a certain size. When there is room in the buffer
 * keep calling read. When there is data in the buffer keep calling write. Handle
 * the buffer in a circular way. No need for any synchronization in this implementation
 * since only one thread is doing all the work.
 *
 * The advantage of this implementation over a simple read and write implementation is that
 * requests for read(2) and write(2) could be issued by this app * at the same time *.
 * This is especially true for read(2) calls which are synchroneous and blocking. In the
 * simple read+write implementation a write will never be issued while a read is runnig
 * which in this implementation we could issue a write while a read is going on. This is
 * especially useful when you are copying files between two different hard disks.
