/*
* Demo the use of glibc assert in C/C++
*
* - assert_perror macro also exists and allows to validate correct results
* from system calls and print the right errors in case of error.
* - the macro NDEBUG controlls whether asserts reduce to nothing or to actual
* checks at runtime.
* - some people control NDEBUG not from the source code but rather from the
* build system where they either light it up for the entire project, turn
* it off for the entire project, or select a subset of translation units
* to turn it on for.
* - people who do not set NDEBUG at the project build level but rather at
* the individual module level usually include it the regular way taking
* heed to set NDEBUG before the include (#define for no assertions, #undef
* or nothing for assertions).
* - you can enable asserts for sections in your code by including assert.h
* whenever you change the value of the NDEBUG macro. This is not something
* most people are comfortable doing.
* - when an assertion fails it prints the executable name, source file name,
* line number, function (unmangled) and the assertion code itself that failed.
* It them proceeds to call abort (you can see all of this using strace).
* - assert(X) should never produce side effects so that the program will behave
* the same whether assertions are enabled or not.
* - The `assert' facility is designed for detecting _internal inconsistency_;
* it is not suitable for reporting invalid input or improper usage to the
* _user_ of the program.
