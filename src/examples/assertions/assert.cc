/*
 * Demo the use of glibc assert in C/C++
 *
 * - assert_perror macro also exists and allows to validate correct results
 * from system calls and print the right errors in case of error.
 * - the macro NDEBUG controlls whether asserts reduce to nothing or to actual
 * checks at runtime.
 * - some people control NDEBUG not from the source code but rather from the
 * build system where they either light it up for the entire project, turn
 * it off for the entire project, or select a subset of translation units
 * to turn it on for.
 * - people who do not set NDEBUG at the project build level but rather at
 * the individual module level usually include it the regular way taking
 * heed to set NDEBUG before the include (#define for no assertions, #undef
 * or nothing for assertions).
 * - you can enable asserts for sections in your code by including assert.h
 * whenever you change the value of the NDEBUG macro. This is not something
 * most people are comfortable doing.
 * - when an assertion fails it prints the executable name, source file name,
 * line number, function (unmangled) and the assertion code itself that failed.
 * It them proceeds to call abort (you can see all of this using strace).
 * - assert(X) should never produce side effects so that the program will behave
 * the same whether assertions are enabled or not.
 * - The `assert' facility is designed for detecting _internal inconsistency_;
 * it is not suitable for reporting invalid input or improper usage to the
 * _user_ of the program.
