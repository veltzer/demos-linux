/*
 * This example investigates the sizeof() of C++ object.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - why is the size of an empty class in C++ 1 and not 0?
 * why is the size of an empty struct in C++ 1 and not 0?
 * this is in contrast to a C struct which, when empty, has size 0. 
 * the answer lies in allocating many these structs/instances. If the size of
 * a single struct/instance is 0 then different structs/instances will
 * have the same pointer pointing to them. This conflict with the C++ ==
 * operator which considers two objects which have the same pointer
 * to them as equal. So C++ has philosphical issues that prevent the possibility
 * of having structs/instances of size 0.
