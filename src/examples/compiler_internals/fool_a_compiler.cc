/*
 * This example shows that you can fool a compiler which is using a register for a loop
 * variable and store something else in the memory location for that variable and have
 * the compiler be very ambiguous about what the value of the variable is.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - The reason why the second value of i is different from the first is that the compiler,
 * forgets about registers whenever calling a remote function (in our case, printf(3)).
 * this means that the compiler is using the register for the first call but the memory
 * location for the second which accounts for the different values.
 * - the reason you need the two print statements at the begining is that otherwise pi or
 * i will get optimized away completely either which will make the trick not work.
 * - notice that on modern Linux systems whenever you run this program you will get different
 * addresses for the variables unlike in older systems where the addresses are constant. This
 * is ASLR (address space randomization) which is a security measure of the kernel that puts
 * the different segments of memory in slightly different locations on each run to protect
 * against hackers. You can turn that off (look at my interesting command lines).
