 * This is an example of a compiler barrier
 * This example needs to be compiled with optimizations to see it in action.
 * View the resulting assembly code with:
 * objdump --disassemble --line-numbers --source --demangle barrier
 *
 * The gcc compiler barrier
 * ========================
 * is the asm(memory) one. It is not a CPU reordering barrier - just a compiler
 * one.
 * It seems that gcc does not have the notion of a *read* vs *write*
 * barrier which could come in handly instead of this dominating
 * *FULL* barrier.
 *
 * Function call barriers
 * ======================
 * On some platforms/compilers these are also memory barriers but not so in gcc
 * that assumes that functions that are called do not change the content of registers
 * (and if they do, they put back everything the way they found it). In any case
 * you cannot really rely on them since you are not sure which functions are macros,
 * inlines etc. Better to use an official compiler barrier. I picked a function that
 * is definately not an inlined one and still this it does not perform well as
 * a compiler barrier (srandom on gcc 4.5.2).
 *
 * Machine memory barriers
 * =======================
 * is the __sync_synchronize() one. There doesn't seem to be a read vs write
 * one. This does not serve as a compiler barrier as is evident as a result
 * of this program.
 *
 * Empty assembly block
 * ====================
 * Used to work in some versions of gcc but stopped working. Better not to use.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - the loop that you see in the code forces the compiler to use a register
 * to hold the 'a' variable (if you compile with optimisation ofcourse).
 * - if you disassemble the code you see that the compiler writes the loop variable
 * (a in our case) back to it's natural place on the stack right after the loop.
 * - after the loop suprisingly, the compiler is certain that the register is still
 * holding the right value for a and so uses it.
 * - without a good compiler barrier the compiler is certain that the value in the
 * register is synchronized with the memory location.

 * TODO:
 * - make this program show the instructions that are emitted for main so
 * that people could see the assembly code generated.
 * - stop using the printing in this example and use the __attribute__((used))
 * gcc feature instead. then I can get ridd of the outfile.
 * this is actually wrong, the documentation of __attribute__((used)) explicitly
 * states that I cannot use it for non static variables so we would need
 * some other mechanism (__attribute__((unused)) ?!?) to force the compiler
 * for forgo warnings on these variables.
