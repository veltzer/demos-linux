 * This example explores the performance of compiler barriers...
 * The conclusion from this is that a compiler barrier is much cheeper
 * than a call to an empty function.
 * Note that both the "__attribute__((noinline))" and the "asm("");" are
 * needed to keep the compiler from removing the call to the function below.
