 * This example compares all sorts of loops that gcc can and
 * cannot optimize away.
 * Consider the question why ? Doesn't gcc simulate your code
 * in order to optimize it away ? The answer is that it does
 * not simulate your code but rather understand the underlying
 * construct to deduce what you are doing and use a predefined
 * set of formulas to precalculate the result...
 *
 * You can what code is  indeed optimized away and what is
 * not when you disassemble the code.
 *
 * Currently, in gcc 4.9.1, the first two loops are optimized
 * away and the third isn't.
