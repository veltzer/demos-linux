 *
 * There are many more attributes that you can attach to functions in order to
 * get more checks from the compiler at compile time and get better code. Check
 * 'info gcc' for more details.
 *
 * Note that you can attach the "unused" attribute to variables as below
 * to avoid warnings about them being unused when you really don't want
 * to check the return value.

	#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-result"
