/*
 * This example shows that the compiler is very aggresive on optimization.
 * It doesn't even unroll the loop! It simply calculates (1+99)*99/2=4950
 * and puts the value in the code (look for $0x1356 in the assembly).
 * Conclusion: DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE COMPILER!
 *
 * Notes:
 * - We cannot turn off optimization in the middle of a function (we get a compile
 * error for such an attempt) and that is why the function which is not optimized
 * is a standalone function.
 * - gcc 4.8 does not do this type of optimization even with -O3
 *
 * this is to make sure that source code interleaving in the disassembly works
 * out well...
 * EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS=-g3
 * this is to make sure that we compile using gcc 4.4 since newer gcc versions
 * do not do this type of optimization...
 * COMPILE_R=g++-4.8
 * LINKE_R=g++-4.8
