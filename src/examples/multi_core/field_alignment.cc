 * This example shows that the compiler aligns fields to 4/8
 * bytes according to whether you are on a on a 32/64 bit CPU.
 * It also shows that malloc always returns aligned memory.
 * It also shows that parameters to functions are 4/8 aligned.
 *
 * The result is that all of your fields are aligned on a 4/8
 * alignment which results in better performance.
