/*
 * This is a demo which shows how, on i386 platforms, to read the rdtsc
 * register in order to get a high precision timer. Mind you, you must
 * be running on a machine that does not do frequency scaling in order
 * for this to work...
 *
 * TODO:
 * - add reading of the cpu frequency.
 * - add diffing the two values.
 * - add measuring absolute time via the cpu frequency.
 *
 * If you compare the results of this test with the cpu frequency information
 * provided by the OS you will find a slight difference.
 *
 * Where does this difference come from?
 * The sleep(3) call which is called here is handled by the OS using the PIC
 * interrupt handler clock while the RDTSC register that we call is from the
 * CPU internal clock. This means that we are comparing two different clocks!
 * In addition to all of this setting the fact that the CPU reports that it's
 * frequency is 600 MHz doesn't means that it ticks: 600,000,000 (600 million
 * times) per seconds exactly...
 *
 * EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS=-lcpufreq
 *
 * TODO:
 * - on multi core the RDTSC reports twice as long. Fix this...
