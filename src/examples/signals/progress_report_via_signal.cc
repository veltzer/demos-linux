 * The variables are global to allow the signal handler to access them easily
 * You DONT need to initialize them to 0 since that is the default.
 * The 'volatile' on i is *critical* since it will be accessed asynchronously
 * and the compiler needs to know not to put it in a register since that
 * will mean that we cannot report it's value correctly from the signal
 * handler.
 * The volatile is also *critical* to force the compiler not to optimize away
 * the entire loop in the main function.

 * That is the reason for the cumbersome code. Hopefylly snprintf(3) is safe
 * enough to use and does not do any memory allocations or the like. write(2),
 * signal(2) and alarm(2) are safe according to the manual.
