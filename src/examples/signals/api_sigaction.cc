/*
 * This is an example of using the sigaction(2) API.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - the same signal handler can be used for handling more than one signal.
 * - if you send a signal when the signal handler is active then it is not
 * activated (meaning that the code that you write need not be re-entrant).
 * - the signal is remmember though and will be activated the first thing after
 * the signal handler is over.
 * - the system does not remmember more than 1 signal. It actually has a bit
 * mask of waiting signals so each waiting signal is either on or off.
 * - the pause(2) call can be used to block until a signal arrives an provide
 * you with a non-busy wait loop on signals.
 * - if you get a signal while inside a signal handler, then the main thread
 * (the one waiting on the pause(2) syscall) will not wake up until you deal
 * with the second one.
 * - if you use sigqueue to signal the process and use a real time signal
 * (SIGRTMIN - SIGRTMAX) and register on them then you will get full guarantee
 * of delivery (unless you congest the os rt signal queue that is - see ulimit
 * -r for details).
 *
 * TODO:
 * - do not call the third argument to the signal handler 'unused' and instead
 * get info out of it (registers?!?). See the example of the libcrash library
 * in order to see how to do that.
