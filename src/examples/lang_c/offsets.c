/*
 * This is an example of finding out how far a field is from the begining
 * of the structure it is embedded in.
 * In a similar example in C++ (using g++ instead of gcc) we had to
 * use '1' instead of '0' in these next macros because g++ is smarter
 * than gcc and translated the 0 to NULL and disallowed it use.
 * In this example, since we are compiling to C we can use 0 freely.
 * Notice that with my macro, offsetof and __builtin_offsetof you can use the
 * "struct" prefix to the structure name or drop it.
