 * This example shows bit fields as they are implemented by the gcc
 * compiler.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - if you pack such a structure the size of the structure will be
 * the number of bits divided by 8 rounded up.
 * - if you don't pack the size will just be sum of the sizes of
 * each field which is, for each field, number of bits divided by
 * 8 rounded up. And all will be rounded up to 4 bytes.
