/*
 * This is an example of how C initializes array of characters.
 * The whole of point of this example is to show that C does not
 * treat initialization of arrays of characters from string
 * literals as initializing strings but rather as initializing
 * arrays. Using a string literal to initialize an array of
 * characters is just convenience as opposed to specifying each
 * individual characters seperately. All the characters in the
 * array which are not explictly initialized will be initialized
 * to 0 (according to the specfication). This goes well with
 * using the content of that array as string, IF, AND ONLY IF,
 * you initialize with less content than the size of the array.
 * But the compiler doesn't force you to do that.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - intializing an array with MORE characters than space in the array
 * WILL create a compile time error.
