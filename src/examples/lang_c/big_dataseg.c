/*
 * This is an example showing C99 initialisation syntax and horrible
 * effect this has on the size of the object file generated from this file.
 * Just look at the size of the executable for this example and you will
 * see what I mean.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - If you switch the initialisation from {1} to {0} then suddenly the size
 * of the object file drops dramatically. This is because initialisation to 0
 * is built in to the toolchain and is done programatically rather than storing
 * the entire data in the data segment.
 * - when you initialize the array using={1} only the first element is initialized.
 * You can initialize more elements of the array by adding more initialization values.
 * The other values of the array will be zero as this example clearly shows.
