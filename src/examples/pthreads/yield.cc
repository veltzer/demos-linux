/*
 * This is a demo for the sched_yield(2) or for pthread_yield(3) which are
 * in effect the same. The difference between these two functions is that
 * sched_yield could be used and should be used in a multi process context
 * while pthread_yield is more appropriate in a multi threaded context.
 *
 * The idea of this demo is to show how two threads yield one to the other
 * using this API and no other synchronization mechanism except an atomic
 * variable. Ofcourse they spin a lot in this example.
 *
 * If you run this demo on a single CPU machine then you will see that
 * the output that you get from the two threads is interwoven which means
 * that they yield one to the other.
 * Ofcourse, this is not strictly a proof that this works since even on a single
 * CPU machine with heavy load it could be that not even the single TRACE executing
 * could fit in a time slot. But you get the idea.
 * If you look at the first runs you would see that one of these threads gets a lot
 * of the CPU. This is because it takes time to create the other thread in the
 * operating system and it seems that yield does not always guarantee that the other
 * thread wins.
 * There is a barrier here also used to jump start the threads at exactly the same
 * time but strictly speaking it is not required for this demo.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - show the number of voluntary context switches going up. Show this via proc
 * or via libproc.
