/*
 * This is an example showing how you can cancel a thread that is doing pure computation.
 * The idea is to set the pthread canceltype to PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - it seems that pure computation is one of the few scenarios where PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
 * is effective as otherwise it would the state of malloc(3) and possibly other data structures
 * and locks in a bad state.
 * - cancelling a thread which is set to PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS happens *immediately* which
 * is good in some cases.
 * - once you cancel the thread it just stops running, you dont get to react to the cancellation.
 * - a cancelled thread gets PTHREAD_CANCELED back as a result from pthread_join(3). This also
 * means that PTHREAD_CANCELED should not be used as a valid return value for a pthread thread.
