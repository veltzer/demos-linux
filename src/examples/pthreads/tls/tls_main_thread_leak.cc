/*
 * This is an example intended to show that the main thread in a multi threaded
 * pthread application does not have it's TLS variables destroyed when it exists.
 *
 * The reason for this is that the main thread in a pthread app exists using exit(3) and not
 * using pthread_exit(3). exit(3) does not call the pthread TLS destuctors. This means
 * that you main thread must take care to destroy it's own TLS data manually or via atexit(3)/on_exit(3) or
 * any other mechanism or avoid using TLS.
 *
 * This means that the main thread in pthreads is 'special' in a way. This is not the only feature
 * that makes it 'special' too. For instance, the main thread will call functions registered
 * via pthread_cleanup_push(3), pthread_cleanup_pop(3).
 *
 * The fact that the main thread is 'special' in several ways leads naturally to the design where
 * the main pthread thread should only do pthread_join(3) and nothing else interesting. This is
 * the recommended design.
