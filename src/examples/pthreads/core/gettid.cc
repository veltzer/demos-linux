/*
 * This demo explored gettid() and getpid() issues on linux
 * This demo shows that:
 * - for the main thread (the one going from the main function) the thread id
 * is the same as the process id.
 * - for other threads the process id is the same but the thread id is different.
 * - pthread_self() is different than all of the above (some opaque value).
 * - there is no wrapper function in libc for gettid. I use a wrapper
 * here that I defined myself in <us_helper.hh>. Check it out. You can either
 * use that or use some framework which gives you wrappers.
