/*
 * This is an example showing a process that always yields the CPU using
 * the official sched_yield(2) system call.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - some people still think that sleep(3) with an argument of 0 will have
 * the same effect as sched_yield(2). This is not the case in Linux
 * where sleep(3) returns to the caller immediately if a parameter of 0 is given
 * to it.
 * - maybe nanosleep(2) with 0 will have better luck of emulating the
 * sched_yield(2) API.
 * - note that this spends little time in user space (10%?!?) and most
 * of the time doing the scheduling in kernel space. You can see this with top(1).
 * - this is kind of an abuse of the kernel scheduler which is forced
 * to run 90% of the time.
 * - the context switches that this process performs are counted as
 * 'nonvoluntary' which is weird. You can see this in '/proc/[pid]/status'.
 * this is weird as they should have been counted as 'voluntary' context switches.
