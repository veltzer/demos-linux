 * Notes
 * - ftok(3) is a userspace function. if you strace this program
 * you will not see any ftok(2) system call or the like.
 * - ftok(3) is deteministic. You can see this if you run this program several times.
 * - the 'proj_id' is just an arbitrary integer that the client and server have to
 * agree upon.
