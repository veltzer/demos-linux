/*
 * This example shows how to use the cleanup framework provided by the standard C library
 * notice that cleanup functions are called in reverse order of their registration
 *
 * Notes:
 * - the same function can be registered multiple times (with atexit(3) or on_exit(3)).
 * - the limit to number of registrations seems to be very high (millions ?!?).
 * - the API to on_exit(3) seems to be a bit better since it allows to pass a pointer
 * and get the exit code which atexit does not allow.
 * - on the other hand the documentation states that atexit(3) is preffered on Linux
 * and some consider on_exit(3) to be deprecated.
 * - calling _exit(2) will end the software immediately and so no handlers will be
 * called.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - show that after forking the child will also do the cleanups.
 * - show what happens if you get a fatal signal.
 * - show what happens to C++ object on the stack when exit(3) is called (do
 * the destructors get called?!?)
