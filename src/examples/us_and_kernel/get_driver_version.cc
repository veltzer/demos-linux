/*
 * This example shows how to extract the version number from a "ko" (kernel object)
 * file...
 *
 * BEWARE: This code DOES NOT WORK!!!
 *
 * This code has led me to the conclusion that modinfo does not use dlopen to get
 * the information from the .ko files but rather mmaps them directly and uses
 * 'man 5 elf' to find the format of the executable file. Do NOT use this code - it
 * will crash your program...
 *
 * How to fix this ?
 * Get your hands on the source code of 'modinfo' and copy the relevant parts here.
 * (publish this in a blog for the interested parties...)
