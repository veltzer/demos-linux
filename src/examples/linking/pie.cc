/*
 * This example shows how to compile an executable with position
 * independent code.
 * You can see that it is position independent by running this one again
 * and again and seeing the different addresses from the kernel ASLR.
 *
 * What you need to do?
 * - compile object with -fpie/-fPIE.
 * - link with -pie.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - -fpie/-fPIE make your code run a little slower on some platformas that do
 * not have elegant relative jump instructions (like i386 but not ia64).
 * - The PIE feature combined with ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) which
 * has been a feature of the Linux kernel for some time now, will give you better
 * protection against hackers.
 *
 * EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS=-fPIE
 * EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS=-pie
