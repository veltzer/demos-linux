 * This is an example of how to use the carriage return character
 * to do some nice output progress reporting without scrolling with standard
 * output...
 *
 * Notes:
 * - we print space after printing to show the general way to use this since our
 * number is going down and not up. In the up case you would not need it.
 * - the 'fflush' is actually needed. Otherwise you would still get updates but
 * only when stdout is flushed naturally which happens only when it's buffer
 * is full or when "\n" is printed.
 *	- you can set stdout for no buffering, use stderr instead, or use direct write(2)
 *	to avoid the extra call to flush.
 *	- ofcouse, you can also use the curses library to do all of this which has a much
 *	richer API but does require some learning.
