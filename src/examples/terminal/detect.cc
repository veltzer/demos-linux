 * This is an example of how to detect whether a file you are using is
 * a terminal or not and print it's name in case it is.
 * This is similar to the tty(1) command line utility.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - The documentation for ttyname states the pointer returned by ttyname(3)
 * may be overwritten by subsequent calls which means that you should duplicate
 * the return value if you want to use it. See below.
 * - It is better to use the ttyname_r(3) function so as not to need to duplicate
 * the resulting string. Also ttyname_r(3) is thread safe.
 * - You can use the name returned to reopen the terminal after it has been closed. See below.
