/*
 * Try to think of the next exercise: try to read just one character from
 * standard input. If you try to do it you will find that the user is prompted
 * for a full line and all you get is that single character. In addition, trying
 * to control the size of the buffer of stdin (say using setvbuf for instance)
 * will not work. Why ?
 *
 * // here are examples of attempts that will not work...
 * const int bufsize=1;
 * char buf[bufsize];
 * // this call does not release until eol...
 * int ret=fread(buf,bufsize,1,stdin);
 * printf("ret is %d\n",ret);
 * // now set the buffereing to no buffering...
 * setvbuf(stdin,NULL,_IONBF,0);
 * // now repeat the same call as above
 * ret=fread(buf,bufsize,1,stdin);
 * printf("ret is %d\n",ret);
 *
 * The reason it does not work because standard input which is the file in
 * question in this example is usually connected to a kernel level terminal
 * device. Terminal devices have buffered input IN THE KERNEL and so only
 * pass off the data once the line is done. This example should be modified
 * to alter the characteristics of the controlling terminal of stdin using
 * the right APIS. 'info libc' and search for terminal to see those API (there
 * is quite a bunch of those).
 *
 * This is an example of how to remove buffering from the terminal and read
 * characters one by one...
