/*
 * This example examines the question of whether it is more efficient to loop
 * from a number down to 0 rather than from 0 to the number. In theory this
 * could have some advantage because comparing to 0 is supposed to be more
 * efficient either in execution or in size of machine instruction when compared
 * to comparison with an arbitrary value.
 *
 * Compile this code and disassemble it using objdump in order to test this
 * question.
 *
 * The disassembly actually proves that counting down is more efficient than
 * counting up in this specific compiler (g++ 4.4.3) since it saves one machine
 * instruction inside the loop.
 *
 * This is for being able to see source code intermingled with assembly code...
 * EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS=-g3
 *
 * TODO:
 * - actually measure the time with a performance counter and see it.
