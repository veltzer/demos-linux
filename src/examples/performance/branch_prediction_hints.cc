/*
 * This is an example of giving hints to the compiler about branchings.
 * Note that:
 * - some cpus have branch prediction in hardware and ignore such hints.
 * - some cpus have branch prediction in hardware and accept such hints.
 * - you can pass flags to the compiler to ignore these hints and create
 * regular branch instructions.
 * - some compiler and/or compiler versions do not actually use this information.
 *
 * Where can this help?
 * It can allow the compiler to reorder the control-flow graph to reduce the number of branches taken for the 'likely' path. This can have a marked improvement in loops where you're checking multiple exit cases.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - on the command line using time(1) this example runs the same with branch prediction and without.
 *	Modify this to have a marked effect on performance and measure itself so that I can show when
 *	this is effective.
