/*
 * This example explores the inner workings of memset...
 *
 * From the disassembly we can see that:
 * - no call to memset is used since memset is a macro.
 *	(you cannot break on memset in the debugger and actually stop on that function)
 * - this means that memset inline assembly is inserted into our code.
 * - the compiler uses "rep stos" to do the actual memsetting which is
 *	a single machine instruction on Intel which means that it is very efficient.
 * - the wmemset function is not inline assembly (you can break on it in the debugger)
 * - this example does not explore the inner workins of the wmemset function
 * (meanins whether it is implemented efficiently or not).
 *
 * this is to make sure that source code interleaving in the disassembly works
 * out well...
 * EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS=-g3

 * TODO:
 * - find out how wmemset works and discuss it's efficiency.
