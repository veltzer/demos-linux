/*
 * This example explores syslog speed as compared to writing to a simple file.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - every messsage that I'm sending to syslog or to file has a number in it. This
 *	has two reasons: the most important is for syslog to actually log the message
 *	since if syslog gets two identical messages it does not log the second. Instead
 *	it waits for sometime and then says that the previous message repeated so and so
 *	times. The second reason is to include the printf like formatting code in the
 *	measurements.
 * - the tested code runs in a high priority thread to make sure that we measure times
 *	correctly.
 * - the fwrite implementation is fast because it does buffering. Maybe you are ok with
 *	that (you may lose data if you crash) and in that case you can use it.
 *
 * Results:
 * - by default you will find that syslog is much much slower than write.
 *	Output for example from this program:
 *	=====================================
 *	doing 1000 syslogs
 *	time in micro of one syslog: 55.897000
 *	doing 1000 writes
 *	time in micro of one write: 0.330000
 *	=====================================
 *	This is because rsyslogd in ubuntu is synchroneous. Most syslogd implementations are
 *	like that.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - add three more test cases: open(2), write(2), close(2) with
 *	- standard flags.
 *	- O_ASYNC
 *	- O_SYNC
 * - add another test with syslog which writes to a sysfs file instead.
 * - add another test case of asynchroneous syslog (damn it! how do I configure that?!?).
 * - explain the results in the text above.
 * - do better stats (min, max, variance and more - max is the most important).
 *
 * EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS=-lpthread
