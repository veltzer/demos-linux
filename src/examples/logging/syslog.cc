/*
 * This example shows syslog basic usage. At the end it demostrates that the log
 * actually reached the system log.
 *
 * It seems that the openlog and closelog are not mandatory...
 * If you leave them out then you will not get your own name as the application
 * name and so you get defaults for parameters passed to openlog.
 *
 * How is syslog implemented? Either as a socket or udp socket. It is listening
 * on /dev/log as a udp socket and logs the messages sent to it.
 *
 * A question that is often raised is what is the performance of syslog compared to
 * printf to a file - the answer is faster since it is sending the data through the socket
 * and does not wait for it to be written to disk. Each call to syslog will actually
 * generate two different system calls: time(2) and then send(2). The time(2) call is
 * in order to log the time that the message was sent at (source time). Then the time
 * is formatted in the form of a date and sent, along with the data, to syslog.
 * You can see all of this if you strace(1) this example. There seems to be no way to
 * tell syslog(3) not to do this timing thing and just send the message.
 *
 * So how long does it take to call syslog? Two system calls worth (pretty long but
 * shorter than writing to a file).
 *
 * See a different example of how to use syslog as a general logging and tracing facility
 * using the vsyslog function.
 *
 * Notice the use of setlogmask in order to control which logs actually go to the log.
