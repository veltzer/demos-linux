/*
 * This example explores compiler builtins like:
 * __FILE__, __LINE__, __func__, __FUNCTION__, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, __BASE_FILE__
 * Which can be used in order to produce better error/logging/debug/warning messages.
 *
 * Notice that if you put the prints, even in an inline function, then you get the data
 * for the ** inline function ** which is the calee and not for the caller. This is
 * probably what you want. A way to change this behaviour is to use a macro
 * (also demonstrated below).
 *
 * Notice that __FILE__ and __LINE__ are different from __func__, __FUNCTION__ and
 * __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ in that the former are supplied by the pre processor and the latter
 * are supplied by the compiler. This distinction however is not very important.
 *
 * A frequently asked question here is how to indent the printing to match the level
 * of stack at which the printing occurs. This is not very easy as there is no variable
 * "stacklevel" or some such which indicated the stack level and can facilitate this.
 * However, you can use function entry and exit handlers, either explicit or implicit,
 * to facilitate this.
 *
 * Another important issue is the difference between __BASE_FILE__ and __FILE__. Usually
 * you want __FILE__ since __BASE_FILE__ is not where you are but rather the main file
 * which you are compiling.
