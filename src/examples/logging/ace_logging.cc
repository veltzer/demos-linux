/*
 * This demo shows the ACE logging facilities
 *
 * ACE_NTRACE: supports whether ACE_TRACE actually does anything. If disabled then ACE_TRACE
 * is nothing. If enabled then:
 * - traces will be printed where the are in the code (ACE_TRACE).
 * - traces will be printed on exit from functions (destructor pattern).
 * - %I can be used in ACE_DEBUG in order to indent messages properly.
 * - functions that do not use ACE_TRACE in them will not show up or contribute
 *	to the trace nesting at all.
 *
 * note that ACE_NTRACE can be enabled/disabled on a per file basis and so can
 * only be enabled at compile time in modules that you want to debug...
