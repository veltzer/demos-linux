 * are not affected by ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).
 * They are also part of the executable and not part of the shared library. That is
 * the PLT.
 * You can also see that the PLT is part of the executable part of your executable, not
 * any of the data segments (the read only or the read/write ones).
 * That is because you jump to it and from it to the real function you are trying to call.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - disassemble the code at the PLT addresses.
