/*
 * This example is very simple. It shows how a specific
 * integer value cannot be represented as float.
 *
 * Why was the specific value chosen (2^24+1)?
 * Because a floating point number on a 32 bit system is divided
 * into 1+7+24=32 bits:
 * 1 bit for the sign
 * 7 bits for the exponent
 * 24 bits for the number
 * In regular number range (whole numbers) of small numbers only
 * the sign and number are used. So this means that the floating
 * point representation should start to mess up at the 2^24 point
 * (and -2^24).
 *
 * This test works on an intel 32 bit system. On other systems
 * your results may be different as the definition of int and float
 * may change or the math hardware may work slightly differently.
