/*
 * This is a C++ example of how to create exceptions which contain a stack trace
 * of where they occured. This uses the backtrace function.
 * Notes:
 * - if you compile with -O2 you get less stack frames in the output
 * since some of the functions are inlined by the compiler.
 * - I added __attribute__((noinline)) to prevent the inlining to see more
 * stack traces. This made the stack frames visible but without the names.
 * If you want to see all stack frames then remove all optimization flags at
 * compile time.
 * - we drop two stack frames that don't interest
 * us (two functions that are above the 'main' function).
 * - yet another issue is C++ name mangling. You can either do that on the command
 * line using the 'c++filt(1)' tool or in the code by using the C++ library.
 * - the '-rdynamic' flag is needed if the 'backtrace_symbols' function is to
 * work and return symbols to you. 
 *

 * TODO:
 * - show how to see the two "nameless" stack frames in the middle (they are not currently seen).
 * - bring back the c++ demangling code (it was removed because it was crashing the app).
