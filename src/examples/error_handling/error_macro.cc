/*
 * This shows how to create a macro to help you deal with errors returned
 * from system calls.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - we emit the code of the offending line.
 * - we copy errno immediately to preserve the original error.
 * - we print errors to stderr and not stdout to correctly separate errors and output.
 * - we do not use strerror(3) to print error explanations and not just numbers because err(3) already does this for us.
 * - we surround the macro with 'do {...} while(0)' for preprocessing reasons.
 * - we do not use err(3) to print the error since it does not accept a custom errno.
 * - we do use error(3) to print the error since it does a better job than err(3).
 * - we do not pass newline to error(3) since it will append the reason for the error and a newline itself.
