/*
 *      This exapmle shows how to obtain a stack trace for various purposes (mostly
 *      for 'self debugging...'...).
 *
 *      Some notes:
 *      - You DO NOT have to compile with debugging information. You will see any
 *      dynamic symbols (for all you DLL lovers - this means every exported symbol
 *      of the DLL which in linux means everything you didn't put 'static' on...
 *      - The thing is that dynamic symbols (ones which are exported) are not enough.
 *      What about functions inside my code which are static and are on the stack? They
 *      will not be in the trace.
 *      - This is why you need to compile with -rdynamic to get those symbols as well.
 *      - How does the backtrace function work? It gets the return address from the stack
 *      and tries to figure out from which function it came. The return address is NOT the
 *      exact pointer to a know function but a pointer to some position within the function
 *      (from whence you were called) but it is within the functions bounds.
 *      - It repeats this process going up the stack.
 *      - If you do this from within a signal handler you may also see the signal handling
 *      stack concatenated with the real stack depending on how you registered your signal
 *      hanlder (with or without it's own stack, see sigaction(2)...). If you registered it
 *      with it's own stack you will not see the real stack at all...
 *      - This example dumps stack traces both from regular context (before a fault) and from
 *      a fault handler.
 *      - Please note that it is problematic to dump a stack trace from within a fault handler
 *      since the underlying libc functions (backtrace_*) are allocating memory via malloc(3)
 *      which may be corrupt at that point.
 *

 * EXTRA_LIBS=-rdynamic
 *
 * TODO:
 * 	- do cxx name demangling.
 * 	- move to registering the handler via sigaction and show how to specify it's own stack
 * 	and the effect of this on the result.
 * 	- show in another example what happens if we do a segfault inside a segfault handler.
 * 	- do the recommendations from the gilad ben yossef slide show:
 * 		pipe the data to another process standing by,
 * 		malloc and heap poisoning
 * 		and more.
