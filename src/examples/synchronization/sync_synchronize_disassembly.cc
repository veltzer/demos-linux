/*
 * This is a demo to show how sync_synchronize() is implemented...
 * You should see the __sync_synchronize which is a machine memory barrier
 * translated to a "lock orl" instruction in assembly which is an instruction
 * to the core you are running on to stop reordering writes and reads
 * and drop all cache assumptions.
 * This is an intel instruction and intel only does read/write reordering.
 * So you should see one instruction in the disassembly of this code.
 * And indeed this is what we see.
 *
 * Take note that this is a also a compiler barrier. It prevents the compiler
 * from reordering around this code and carrying assumptions across the barrier.
 * You don't see any assembly emitted for that since a compiler barrier is only
 * a compile time instruction about future code emittion.
 *
 * There are other examples of other ways to achieve memory fences on x86
 * but the differences between all of these various ways are not explained.
 *
 * this is so disassembly will show interleaved code
 * EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS=-g3
