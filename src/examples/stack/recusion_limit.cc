 * This program finds the recusion limit.

 * NOTES:
 * - if this is a tail recursion then gcc may eliminate the recursion.
 * that is why we have a double call below.
 * - you can set the stack limit via 'ulimit -s'.
 * - 'ulimit -s unlimited' seems to offer a stack which can grow up to the
 * whole systems RAM.
