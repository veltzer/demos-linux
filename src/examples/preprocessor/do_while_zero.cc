/*
 * This example explores the do { ... } while(0) macro construct.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - do-while(0) allows you to break in the middle of a multi-statement macro.
 * see the example below.
 * - if you use do-while(0) correctly and define your macro WITHOUT a semi-colon
 * at the end of the definition then your user will be forced to put a semi-colon
 * him/her self. This is good since this means that the do-while(0) construct
 * behaves like a real function call, which means that if, in the future, you would
 * like to substitute the macro for a real (inline?) function, you could.
