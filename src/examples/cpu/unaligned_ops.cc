/*
 * This example tries to abuse the cpu by doing lots of integral
 * operations on addresses which are not 4 byte aligned and showing
 * the difference in performace between these and properly aligned
 * operations.
 *
 * Results:
 * It seems that on modern Intel platforms data alignment is not an issue.
