 * This example shows how to correctly define your own malloc functions so that gcc will
 * work correctly with them.
 *
 * The use of the alloc_size attribute allows the compiled built in functions to know
 * the size of the object.
 *
 * The compiler uses these hints to know that the pointer returned by the functions is a new
 * pointer and therefore will not be equal to any pointer seen the in the past
 * (malloc and calloc should have it, realloc will not).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - show how the compiler uses the info in disassebly.
