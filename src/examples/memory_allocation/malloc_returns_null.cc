 * This example explores when it is exactly that malloc(3) returns NULL.
 * The answer is when virtual memory is over.
 * On a 64bit box this seems to be around 100,000 gigs.
 * Need to see how this works on a 32 bit box.
 * Another note is that malloc, even on a 64bit box, does not allocate more than 4gigs in one allocation.
