/*
 * This example explores the use of limits in source code.
 * You can limit the size of your programs RAM
 * and crash long before you get into swapping (recommended).
 * Many more types of limits exist. Try to use as much of them as possible.
 * set setrlimit(2) for more details.
 *
 * Note that if you do not set a limit on your memory size then on a 64 bit
 * system you can allocate ludicrous amounts of ram (131,000 GB anyone?).
 *
 * Setting of limits is controlled:
 * - at login time from /etc/security/{limits.conf,limits.d}
 * - from the command line using such shell builtins as ulimit(1) of bash (here you can only lower limits).
 * - from your source code (here you can only lower limits).
 * This is an example of the third option.
