 * This example shows how to use the glibc varargs support to write a var
 * args function that calls another varargs function.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - we use the program_invocation_short_name which is an external name of
 * our own program. much like argv[0] only we don't need to pass argv until
 * the point we wish to use it.
 * - unlike the corresponding builtin va_* compiler internals we can use this
 * code on any system conforming to the 'stdarg' standard which means this
 * is quite portable.
 * - We use the __attribute__ feature to make sure the compiler checks that
 * we are passing the arguments right (gcc feature).
