/*
 * This example shows how to use prctl to set/get the current process name.
 * The name itself is up to 16 bytes long.
 * It also shows that this is reflected in the output of tools like ps and in the /proc
 * filesystem.
 * Notice that the 'comm' attribute is what you are setting getting (/proc/[pid]/comm,
 * ps -o comm) and not other attributes like command, cmd and others from ps or from /proc.
 *
 * When would you want to use this?
 * - when you're doing lots of multi processing (fork(2)) and want to distinguish between
 * the various processes.
 * - when whatever it is that your doing depends on how you were run (envrionment,
 * directory, conditions that you find, time of day, argv[0], whatever...).
 * - set names of threads in a multi threaded application (will be in a separate demo).
 *
 * TODO:
 * - add a fork(2) to this demo and show that parent and child can have different names.
