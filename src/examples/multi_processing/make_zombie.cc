/*
 * This example demostrates how processes become zombies in Linux...
 *
 * How does a process become a zombie in Linux ?
 * - The parent creates the process.
 * - The process ends.
 * - The parent does not collect the processes return code using one of
 * the wait(2) family of functions.
 *
 * Note that if the parent dies then init(1) will actually serve as the
 * new parent for the child process (sort of adoption) and will clear the
 * child. So a zombie is always a process with a live parent (unless there
 * is a bug in init(1), ofcourse...).
 *
 * We show the status of the child in this application in two ways:
 * - using the ps command.
 * - using the libproc library.
 * - catting
 *
 * From the command line you can also see info about zombies using:
 * - ps(1) (done in this example).
 * - catting files from the /proc folder (done in two ways in this example).
 * - top(1)
 *
 * putting 'pkg-config --libs libprocps' in the next line does not work
 * since there is no dynamically linked libprocps.
 * EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libprocps.a
