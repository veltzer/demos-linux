/*
 * An example of using vfork(2)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - if you let the child return from main it will cause a segfault.
 * - this is ok because the documentation of vfork states explicitly that you
 * should not return from the function.
 * - tracing seems to work fine and sleep(3) also.
 * - writing to the parent data does not seem to be harmful. The parent sees these
 * writes as the pages are shared.
 * - result: the return from the function in which vfork was called is the one
 * causing the segfault.
 * - the segfault seems to be in the parent not in the child. Need to check this
 * for sure.
 * - the results of using vfork incorrectly (not for exec) are indeed undefined as the manual page says.
