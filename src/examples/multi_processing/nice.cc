/*
 * This demo is to be used when demoing nice level.
 * Run a couple of these processes and look at the output.
 *
 * A few notes about this example:
 * - as you can see nice(2) is a "soft" priority. All of these processes are very
 * busy but still the ones with the bigger nice value manage to get a few
 * instructions executed at some point in time...
 * - from the command line you can start a process with a certain nice level
 * by using:
 * nice --adjustment=[nice level] [command with args]
 * or you can set a nice level of a process after it has started with the renice
 * command:
 *
 * You can see the nice level of your process via ps using the %n value:
 * ps -o %n,...
 *
 * You can see the nice level of a process via the /proc filesystem using
 * the following command: 
 * cat /proc/[pid]/stat | cut -f 19 -d " "
 * (see man 5 proc for more details...)
