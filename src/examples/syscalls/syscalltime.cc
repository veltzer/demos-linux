/*
 * This demo times how long it takes to call a syscall.
 * It is a simple loop surrounded by gettimeofday.
 * We do call this code in high priority to make sure we do not get context switched
 * which will cause our measurements to be off.
 *
 * How long is it?
 * About 1/3 or even 1/5 mic on a fast computer.
 * About 1.2 mic on my old laptop.
 * About 0.5 mic on my new laptop.
 * Probably more on ARM processors although I am not sure.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - notice that syscall(__NR_getpid) is a little faster than gettimeofday. Obviously - it doesn't need
 * to get the time in the kernel.
 * - notice that getpid() is MUCH faster than syscall(__NR_getpid) because it caches the pid in user
 * space. It does not get optimized out (checked the disassembly). It also states that it is cached in user space since some version of glibc (check out man getpid())
 * - we also measure the time of a function call in user space, which, as expected, is a lot faster than even simple system calls.
