 * This is an example of infinite recursion prevention using setting the stack size
 *
 * Notes:
 * We really have to force the compilers hand into calling the function again and again
 * since we compiler this module in optimized mode.
 *
 * three ways to do this:
 * - put the noinline attribute on the function. This is no good since the compiler
 *	will respect this when other functions call this function but not when this function
 *	calls itself. We could have used this with mutual recursion.
 * - have the function do some side effect. This has the same problems as above. Again,
 *	mutual recursion could have helped.
 * - have the function call itself several times. This saved the day for this example.
