 * This is an example showing how to capture the output stream comming out of a child
 * process running a shell command of your choosing.
 *
 * Remember that popen(3) wraps fork(2)/wait(2)/pipe(2)/read(2) shell and more.
 * It this example we run 'ls /etc' and read the results from it.
 *
 * You need to do the following things:
 * - call popen with "r" (as opposed to "w")
 * - read the resulting FILE stream until eof of file.
 * - do something with the output (in this example we simply print it out to the screen).
 * - pclose(3) the stream.
