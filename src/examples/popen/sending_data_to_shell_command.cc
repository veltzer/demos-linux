 * This is an example showing how to use popen(3) to send data to a shell
 * command.
 *
 * Remember that popen(3) wraps fork(2)/wait(2)/pipe(2)/read(2) shell and more.
 * It this example we run 'bc -l' and send questions to it.
 *
 * You need to do the following things:
 * - call open with "w" (as opposed to "r").
 * - write data to the FILE stream returned from popen.
 * - remember to pclose(3) the FILE stream.
