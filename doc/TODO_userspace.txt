- do an example of using /dev/rtc and /dev/hpet...
- do a standalone example of lto optimizations (man gcc/search for lto).
- do an example of hugetlbfs.
- core dump example: show how an application can dump its own core
	and continue running (gcore on the cmd line, sending itself a signal,
	running the right function).
- give an example of a binary that accesses it's own symbols by name.
	ld_ functions with NULL.
- do a user space example that compares various ways of getting a time stamp
	(rdtsc, gettimeofday, getclock, ...)
- do a user space program that measures the rdtsc progress vs time
	and compares it to the values taken from the cpufreq library.
- do an example that links dlls together and create a "mega dll".
- do an example that links object files + a bunch of dlls into a "exe + dlls in one file" package.
	This way this exe can have backtrace capability with good symbol names. Demo it.
- do a demo of using the rtc in an application.
	demo the accuracy of those sleeps as compared to an application using a regular clock
	show that when using the RTC the interrupts are coming in (/etc/interrupts) not via
	the timer interrupts but rather through the RTC line...
- add a demo about how to catch this exception from regular C code using signal and
	sigaction and show what can be done about it (c level).
- example of how to raise exceptions on all system calls.
	C++ wrapper for all system calls.
- examples of debugging malloc stuff:
	showing statistics of malloc,
	hooking into the malloc free hooks
	replacing the malloc library.
- expand the example BreakOut.cc to show that you can break out of other system calls too (for example shmget).
- write an example using futexes.
- write an example that demostrates priorities.
	a. Show an example showing different nice levels.
	b. Show an example showing priority in the same nice level.
	c. Show running a real time process.
	d. Show inversion of priority.
- write an example using NTPL and not posix threads.
- examples using NTPL.
- starting a thread in suspended mode (pthread or NTPL).
- show code of mutexes in pthread with timeout.
- application which receives a SIGTERM and in the sig handler
	marks a boolean value for the main application to check.
	The main application runs in a loop and checks the boolean
	variable regularly and stops it's work once the signal arrives.
- application which generates a SIGSEGV by doing some illegal
	memory access. The application handles this signal in it's
	own code and then calls the default handler (which creates
	a core dump).
- Application which shows how to pass extra information using
	a signal handler.
- application which generates an FPE, then does not core dump
	but rather continues processing. Show how to know where the FPE
	came from (extra information?).
- Show combinations of signal handlers and C++ exceptions. Where
	do they conflict and where do they match.
- profile how long it takes to setup a timer from user space.
	(this is for the userspace guys - do an example).
- show how to break from a blocking sys call in user space using a signal.
	show how to do this using a timer thus turning each sys call to timed.
	show that the wakeup is pretty near the expected time (rdtsc).
- do example of fifo and priorities in pthreads.
- add example of a process doing a fork and the child (or parent) giving themselves
	a different name so that they would appear differently in the process table
	(show the process table from the program). - I think I already have a sample like this.
- creating temp files correctly:
	mkdtemp(3), mktemp(3), tempnam(3), tmpfile(3), tmpnam(3)
	talk about the security issues involved in these.
	there is already one example of mine which works with temp files.
- do a demo of two processes syncing via futex in shared memory (c++ stuff).
- do a demo of using compare and set to sync two processes (c++ stuff).
