- the idea is to have a web site that discusses the C linuxapi.
- it should show the code samples from the git (or parts of them with references to the full example).
- you could seach for examples according to tags too.
- and ofcourse we need a discussion forum about each example.
- and we need to host it on a google webapp or amazon machine.
