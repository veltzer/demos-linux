Syllabus for Linux real time programming: 3 days (estimated)
============================================================
Prerequisitites:
================
C programming (C++ if C++ issues are to be discussed)
UNIX API familiarity
Knowledge of UNIX philosophy and design.
If no such knowledge exists then the course could be made longer
to accomodate with an intro about UNIX/Linux philosophy, command line usage, boot process and more.

Target audience:
================
Experienced C/C++ programmers (3 years minimum).
