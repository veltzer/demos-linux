Monitoring and debugging in the Linux environment

Description: This course is intended for programmers who wish to monitor their C/C++ apps
on a linux system, tune their linux system to their needs, modify the boot process and more

What this course does not cover:
- writing scripts
- interacting with the shell
- login/logout
- using debugger (local or remote)

Duration: 3 days
