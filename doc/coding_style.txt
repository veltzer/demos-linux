- includes:
	#include<stdio.h> // for printf(3) 
	* no space after the include keyword
- return from main:
	return EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE
	(unless I have a better error code).
- main prototype:
	int main(int argc,char** argv,char** envp) {
	}
- functions:
	open on the same line:
	int add(int a,int b) {
		return a+b;
	}
- tabs: real ones, 8 characters
- no two spaces in a row.
- no space and then newline
- no tab and then newline
- no three newlines in a row
	* to keep code concise so that it could be shown easily.

- protection of h files:
	#ifndef _file_name_abs_h
	#define _file_name_abs_h
	...
	#endif /* !_file_name_abs_h */
	rationale: if it's good enough for GNU it's good enough for me
