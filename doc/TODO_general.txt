- find a general solution for storing TODO items inside source files.
	the idea is that I will be able to extract all of those
	todo items easily and track them.
	Each TODO item should be able to be a multi lined item.
	I should be able to identify them easily.
	I should be able to put them into both types of comments
		(// and /* ... */)
	I should be able to put them into the begining and in the
	middle of the code.
	I should know when the TODO item ends.
	convert all TODO items to this type of notation.
- finish the slides about the streams library in glibc.
	add write and read buffering.
