TODO list for the build system for these examples:
==================================================
- add checkpatch.pl on the standalone modules too...
- my build system does not work well for kernel samples with -j.
	try to build all (make clean and then make -j 4) and you
	will see the errors.
	fix this.
- make the standalone folder examples use ccache too (as derived from
	the main makefile).
- make the kernel use ccache too?!?
