- make the build system for this package use precompiled headers.
- add checkpatch.pl on the standalone modules too...
- my build system does not work well for kernel samples with -j.
	try to build all (make clean and then make -j 4) and you
	will see the errors.
	fix this.
- make the standalone folder examples use ccache too (as derived from
	the main makefile).
- make the kernel use ccache too?!?
- the assembly examples will probably not compile on 64 bit. Fix that.
- kernel folder does not rebuild cleanly. Try touching the makefile
	and seeing the kernel rebuild again and again. This is because
	the kernel makefile does not rebuild anything in the modules
	and so their date remains. I need to touch the modules at
	my own makefile so that this does not happen.

build system:
- make the demos-linux project compile for new ubuntu users
	(by default without intel compiler, without papi and without fcmp).
- see that there are no warnings in eclipse.
	(run the eclipse c++ validation tool out of eclipse).
- make a script to update the README.md file with real stats of this project.
	(python preprocessor?). Run it whenever we release a version.
- make sure EXIT_SUCCESS is everywhere (how do I test this?!?).
