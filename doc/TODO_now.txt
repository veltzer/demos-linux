- the license in the files is LGPL while the master license and
the README.md talke about GPL3. Make up my mind and fix this
situation.

- implement condition using event fds
	- demostrate the use.
- add features to my epoll echo server:
	- add timeout support.
	- handle writes well.
	- add http protocol support.
- fix bugs in my timerfd example.
	- do a function that prints timespecs nicely.

- get more examples from http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/
- http://gjcarneiro.blogspot.co.il/2010/10/c-stl-containers-memory.html

slides:
- write slides about room for optimization.
- write slides about allocating memory fast.
- write slides about patterns.
	start with the proactor pattern.
- write slides about restrict.
- padding of structures and aligning structures in gcc and intel.
	with examples.
- the intel compiler:
	- how to install it on Linux.
	- comparison of intel compiler to gcc
		- performance examples (already have one)
	- compatibility of the intel compiler to the gcc compiler
		- do example of C++ compatibility for the intel compiler.

precompiled headers:
	- do standalone gcc precompiled headers example in linuxapi.
	- do standalone intel precompiled headers example in linuxapi.
	- make the linuxapi package itself use precompiled headers.
- mouse device driver example.
- executable library example.
	(still not fully done although getting there).
- make a script to update the README.md file with real stats of this project.
	(python preprocessor?). Run it whenever we release a version.
- add a test to make sure that all source files begin with my header.
- make sure EXIT_SUCCESS is everywhere (how do I test this?!?).
