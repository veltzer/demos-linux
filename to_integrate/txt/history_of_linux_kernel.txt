Linus Torvalds 91-96
	When linus had the it's original design:
	Only one core
	When you enter the kernel with a system call you disable all interrupts.
	When you get back to user space you enable all interrupts.

	What type of lock was used in the kernel?
	No lock needed!

Alan Cox 96-01
	Multi core systems
	Invented the BKL
	Every time you go into the kernel you:
		- disable all interrupts on the current CPU
		- acquire the BLK

	What type of lock was used in the kernel?
	No lock needed! (except the BKL).

Robert Love 01-07
	Multi core systems
	Each kernel data structure is protected by it's own lock

	What type of lock was used in the kernel?
	spinlock_irq

Ingo Molnar 01-21
	Multi core systems
	Each kernel data structure is protected by it's own lock
			+ Every lock is reduced to minimum locking time
	Author of the Real Time Patch (with Thomas Gleixner)

	Real time patch introduced the following features:
	- Turned all spinlock_irqs to mutexes.	
	- all hardware interrupts are handled in threads
