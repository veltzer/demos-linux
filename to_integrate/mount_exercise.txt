In this exercise we want to create a file to be used as a disk,
format the file, mount it, put some files on it, umount it,
mount it again, see the files are still there, umount it,
and destroy the file.

create the big file:
	sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=big_file count=2097152
format the file to ext4:
	sudo mkfs.ext4 big_file
create a folder to mount the file at:
	sudo mkdir /mnt/my_file
mount the file:
	sudo mount big_file /mnt/my_file -o loop
put some file on the new disk
	go to /mnt/my_file
	and create some files there...
umount the file:
	sudo umount /mnt/my_file
mount again:
	sudo mount big_file /mnt/my_file -o loop
See the that files are still there
umount:
	sudo umount /mnt/my_file
destroy the big file:
	sudo rm big_file
