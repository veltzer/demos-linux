1) Show all processes on your linux box that take more than 500 Megs of virtual ram,
sorted by virtual ram from largest to smallest.
What should you use:
ps sort awk

Bonus: repeat the exercise in python.
Compare the two solutions (advantages and disadvantages).

2) Write a bash script that saves all the names of all the packages you have installed to a file, one package
name per line. 
Use dpkg(1)

3) Show your current list of key pairs using gpg(1)
Create a private/public key for yourself using gpg(1).
Show your current list of key pairs using gpg(1). Do you see your new key?

4) Use the key you created earlier to encrypt the content of the /etc/passwed file.
Now decprypt it using that key.

5) ram disk
* Hard exercise.
Create a virtual ram disk of 100MB size and mount it on your linux system.
Let a mortal user (yourself use it).
Show that you can store data on it.
Unmount it.
