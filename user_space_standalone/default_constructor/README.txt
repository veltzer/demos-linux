This example shows that regular C++ (even without templates) compiles a default construtor
into EVERY compilation unit that uses classes of that type.
As you can see the constructor of A has the " W " sign in the object file which means "it's ok if there are many like it...".
Notice that the object "B" which seems to need a constructor of it's own doesn't seem to get one. This is probably due to the fact that it has no parents and so no-one to call...

This:
- makes the object files bigger.
- requires the "W" flag from the linker to prevent multiple declarations of the same constructor
to create link errors.

do "make show" to see this.
