How to turn off portwell hardware interrupts (SMI interrupts) ?
===============================================================
Solution: write to address 0x430 (1072 dec) the value
		0x2B (43 dec) - to disable SMI only interrupts.
		0x2E (46 dec) - to disable all hardware interrupts.
The value which is there by default is 0x6F (111 dec) - this means all enabled.

How can you do this? Checkout the ctst/writeport_out.c program which lets you do this...
Also checkout the ctst/readport program which lets you read ports...
Notice that you have to call iopl to set permissions before.

The command to run is:
./writeport_out 1072 46

You can use devmem2 for this:
sudo devmem2 1072 b 46

to turn them back on:
sudo devmem2 1072 b 111
